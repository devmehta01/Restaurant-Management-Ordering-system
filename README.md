# Restaurant-Management-Ordering-system
In this code, I have implemented a restaurant management and ordering system.

4 Functionalities have been given:
1. Taking the order of the customer
2. Adding an item to the menu
3. Removing an item frmo the menu
4. Displaying the current menu

The menu consists of a serial number for the dish, the name of the dish, the type of diet (i.e. Vegetarian or Non-vegetarian), and the cost of the food item.
The menu has been implemented using a C++ structure.

## 1. Take order
3 functionalities have been given to take an order:
1. Choosing by the serial number
2. Choosing by the name of the dish
3. Choosing by the type of diet (In this method, the customer chooses the diet type. This results in a display of all items in that diet type out of which the customer can choose.)

## 2. Add item
This method prompts the admin to enter the serial number, name of dish, type of diet, and the cost of the dish. Before adding the dish to the menu, it checks if the serial is taken or not and if it is not taken then the item is added to the menu.

## 3. Remove item
2 functionalities have been given to remove an item:
1. Choosing by the serial number
2. Choosing by the name of the dish

## 4. Display Menu
Displays all the items currently on the menu
